## The history of mobile devices

The history of portable devices dates back to the 1960s when the first handheld calculator was
introduced (Chiba et al., 2012). Since then, portable devices have evolved rapidly, becoming more
powerful and versatile. One of the earliest portable devices that could access the Internet was the
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which was introduced in the 1990s (Wiggins, 2014). PDAs were
small, handheld devices that could be used to store and retrieve information, as well as connect to
the internet via a wireless modem.
The next significant development in portable devices was the introduction of smartphones,
which combined the functionality of a PDA with that of a mobile phone. The first smartphones,
such as the Nokia 9000 Communicator and the Ericsson R380, were introduced in the late 1990s
and early 2000s (West and Mace, 2010). These early smartphones were limited in their capabilities,


but subsequent iterations, such as the iPhone and the Android devices, have become more powerful,
offering advanced features such as high-quality cameras, voice assistants and biometric
authentication.
