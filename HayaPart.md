## The history of mobile devices

  The history of portable devices dates back to the 1960s , A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio communications from ships and trains. 
  The first handheld calculator was introduced (Chiba et al., 2012). Since then, portable devices have evolved rapidly, becoming more powerful and versatile. One of the earliest portable devices that could access the Internet was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which was introduced in the 1990s (Wiggins, 2014). PDAs were small, handheld devices that could be used to store and retrieve information, as well as connect to the internet via a wireless modem.
The next significant development in portable devices was the introduction of smartphones, which combined the functionality of a PDA with that of a mobile phone. The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in New York City on 3 April 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).
