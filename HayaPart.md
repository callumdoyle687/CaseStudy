## Historical development of mobile devices

  The history of portable devices dates back to the 1960s , A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. The first handheld calculator was introduced (Chiba et al., 2012). Since then, portable devices have evolved rapidly, becoming more powerful and versatile. One of the earliest portable devices that could access the Internet was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which was introduced in the 1990s (Wiggins, 2014). PDAs were small, handheld devices that could be used to store and retrieve information, as well as connect to the internet via a wireless modem.
  The next significant development in portable devices was the introduction of smartphones, which combined the functionality of a PDA with that of a mobile phone.

  **So, when were mobile phones invented?**
  
  The history of mobile phones, and particularly smartphones, go all the way back to 1908 when USA patent was issued in Kentucky for wireless telephone.
  Mobile phones were invented as early as the 1940s when engineers working at AT&T developed cells for mobile phone base stations.
  The very first mobile phones were not really mobile phones at all. They were two-way radios that allowed people like taxi drivers and the emergency services to communicate.
  Instead of relying on base stations with separate cells (and the signal being passed from one cell to another), the first mobile phone networks involved one very powerful base station covering a much wider area.

  ### Landmarks in mobile history
  Mobile telephony has a long history that started off with experiments of communications from and to moving vehicles rather than handheld devices.

  1926: The first mobile telephony service was offered to first-class passengers on the Deutsche Reichsbahn journeying between Berlin and Hamburg.

  1946: The first calls were made on a car radiotelephone in Chicago. Due to the small number of radio frequencies available, the service quickly reached capacity.

  1956: The first automated mobile phone system for private vehicles launched in Sweden. The device to install in the car used vacuum tube technology with a rotary dial and weighed 40 kg.

  1973: Dr Martin Cooper general manager at Motorola communications system division made the first public mobile phone call that weighed 1.1 kg.

  1996/97: UK phone ownership stood at 16% of households. A decade later the figure was 80%. The explosion in growth was in part driven by the launch of the first pay-as-you-go, non-contract phone service, Vodafone Prepaid, in 1996.

  1999: First BlackBerry phone was also unveiled. Famous for its super-easy email service, BlackBerry handsets were seen as the ultimate business tool, allowing users to read and respond to emails from anywhere. This led to 83% of users reading and responding to work emails while on holiday, and over half admitted to sending emails on the toilet, winning the manufacturer the nickname CrackBerry.

  2000: The all-conquering Nokia 3310 crash landed on shop shelves. It went on to sell 126 million units. Over in Japan, the first commercially available camera phone, the Sharp J-SH04, launched in November 2000 in Japan. You could only use it in Japan. Europe wouldnâ€™t get its first camera phone until the arrival of the Nokia 6750 in 2002.

  2003: The 3G standard begins to be adopted worldwide, kicking off the age of mobile internet and paving the way for the rise of smartphones.

  2007: The iPhone debuted. Solely available on O2 at launch in the UK and priced at a then eye-watering $499.

  2008: The first Android phone, in the form of the T-Mobile G1 arrived. 

  2010: Samsung launched its first Galaxy S smartphone. Usurping former Android giants, HTC, the Samsung Galaxy S range is still the most popular Android brand.
